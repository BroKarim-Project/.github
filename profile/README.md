#coding by googling

**CodingByGoogling** is a personal note featuring tutorials, tips, and tricks related to programming created by [BroKarim](https://www.brokariim.co/). As someone who’s constantly learning, I know the world of coding is vast, and no one masters it overnight. That’s why I’m committed to improving just 1% every day, and I invite you to join me on this journey of growth, one line of code at a time.


## What we googling
Let’s be real—there’s no set curriculum here😝. \
\
This section is all about what random programming topics I’m curious about at any given moment. Could be JavaScript one day, Python the next day, or some mysterious CLI command that makes me question everything (fun times!).
Basically, it’s whatever programming mystery I’m solving based on my mood and how many tabs I’ve opened.
